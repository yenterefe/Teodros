**Third-Person Action Adventure**

A Unity-powered third-person action-adventure prototype focused on learning modern game development workflows—including input handling, AI navigation, and modular architecture.

**About the Project**

This is a work-in-progress third-person action-adventure game built in Unity. The project is paused until asset and animation deliveries are finalized, but it already serves as a strong foundation for experimenting with modern Unity systems and gameplay mechanics.

The goal was to go beyond basics and explore a full gameplay loop, complete with player control, combat, and AI.


**Key Features**

New Input System – Robust player control using Unity's latest input system

Cinemachine – Dynamic camera behavior for exploration and combat

NavMesh – AI enemies with navigation and chase behavior

Modular Code – Separation of responsibilities (input, movement, combat, interaction)

Basic Combat System – Melee attack logic, targeting, and hit detection


**What’s Working**

Smooth third-person movement and camera transitions

Enemy AI using Unity’s NavMesh

Basic player attack/combat system

Structured, component-based architecture for scalability

**In Progress / To Be Done**

Refactor and clean up existing logic

Replace placeholder assets and animations

Polish combat feedback and gameplay feel

Expand and stabilize the inventory system

Design and implement explorable levels

**Current Status**

On Pause – Waiting on finalized art assets and animations from the artist before resuming core gameplay development and polish.

**Final Notes**

This project has been an excellent exercise in applying modern Unity practices and structuring scalable gameplay systems. Once visual assets are in place, development will resume to bring the game closer to a playable prototy
